Rink allows specifying datetimes using **\#date#** syntax in queries. This
file defines the patterns that are used to try to match the specified
date.

Description
-----------

Blank lines are ignored. Lines starting with # are ignored.

A date pattern is a sequence of keywords which each specify a token to
match. part of the sequence can be wrapped with [] to make it optional.

The valid keywords are:

**fullyear**::
	The full 4 digit year, like 2024. Must be exactly 4 digits.

**shortyear**::
	Shortened 2-digit year, like 24. Must be exactly 2 digits.

**century**::
	The year with the last 2 digits cut off, like 20. Not the same as
	the actual century number (which would be 21). Must be exactly 2 digits.

**monthnum**::
	The current month number, like 03. Must be exactly 2 digits.

**day**::
	The current day of the month, like 3. Can be any number of digits.

**fullday**::
	The current day of the month, like 03. Must be exactly 2 digits.

**min**::
	The current minute of the hour, like 05. Must be exactly 2 digits.

**ordinal**::
	The current day of the year, like 083. Must be exactly 3 digits.

**isoyear**::
	The ISO year, like -0001. Must be exactly 4 digits. ISO year unifies
	CE and BCE such that 1BC is year 0, and 2BCE is year -1.

**year**::
	The current year, like 2024. Can be any number of digits.

**adbc**::
	Looks for `ad`, `ce`, `bc`, or `bce` (case insensitive). This allows
	specifying dates prior to year 1 CE.

**hour12**::
	The current hour on a 12-hour clock. Must be exactly 2 digits.

**hour24**::
	The current hour on a 24-hour clock. Must be exactly 2 digits.

**meridiem**::
	Looks for `am` or `pm` (case insensitive). This allows specifying
	12-hour time.

**sec**::
	The current second of the current minute. Must be exactly 2 digits.
	Can optionally have a decimal point to specify time smaller than a
	second.

**offset**::
	Matches a timezone offset. This can either be the name of a timezone
	like `US/Pacific` or a fixed offset. The fixed offset can either be
	in the form +07:00 or +0700.

**monthname**::
	Matches English month names, case insensitive. Recognizes 3-letter
	names (like jan, feb, mar) and full names.

**weekday**::
	Makes English weekday names, case insensitive. Recognizes 3-letter
	names (like mon, tue, wed) and full names.

**today**:: 
	Use the current date, but not the time. Most useful when combined
	with `relative`.

**now**::
	Use the current time and date. Most useful when combined with
	`relative`.

**relative**::
	Matches a relative unit, like `+1h` to add 1 hour, or `-7week` to
	subtract 7 weeks. This is calendar aware, instead of working in
	seconds.

**`-`**::
	Matches a literal `-` character.

**`:`**::
	Matches a literal `:` character.

` `::
	A single space will match any amount of whitespace.

`&`::
	Allows putting two terms directly next to each other without spaces
	in between.

**`'`** <__anything__> **`'`**::
	Wrapping text in single quotes will match that text literally.
