rink-defs - Rink's `definition.units` format
endif::[]

Description
-----------

The units database is a textual document containing the definitions of
units, prefixes, base units, quantities, and substances.

Comments start with `#` and continue to the end of the line. Blank lines
are ignored. Comments can be placed on the same line as units, at the
end.

[listing]
 # This line is a comment
 # And so is this

Units
~~~~~

Units are defined with their name and their definition separated by
whitespace. A definition can be broken over multiple lines using `\` if
desired.

[listing]
foot                    12 inch

Documentation comments are lines starting with `??`. They apply to the
next definition following them. They are shown to end users in Rink when
you query a definition.

[listing]
?? International yard and pound, since July 1, 1959.
?? Documentation comments can be broken over
?? multiple lines.
foot                    12 inch

Substances
~~~~~~~~~~

Substances can represent either a specific object (such as the Earth, or
the Sun), a material such as water or concrete, a chemical molecule, an
element of the periodic table, or an elementary particle.

A substance has a name, an optional symbol (used for chemical formulas),
and contains a list of properties inside of a {} block.

Properties can either be "const", which is mainly used for countable
objects such as a particle, or they can be a ratio, such as the density
of a material.

[listing]
neutron {
    mass                const neutron_mass          1.00866491588 u
    wavelength          const neutron_wavelength    planck_constant / mass c
    magnetic_moment     const neutron_moment        -0.96623650e-26 J/T
}

The two syntax variants for properties are:

[listing]
 [name] const [output name] [expression]
 [name] [input name] [input expression] / [output name] [output expression]

The input name and output name can get very confusing. The idea with
these is to allow for contextual properties to be calculated from ratios
such as the density. For example, `mass of 1ml water`. For this to work,
`density` (mass divided by volume) is defined with 3 names: `density`
(the ratio itself), `mass`, and `volume`.

[listing]
 density mass 1g / volume cm^3

These conversions work the other direction too: `volume of 1g water`.

Categories
~~~~~~~~~~

Units inside the same category will be grouped together in the UI when
doing searches and other operations. A category is started using the
`!category` pragma which takes an identifier (`lower_snake_case`) and a
display name as a string literal.

[listing]
!category us_survey "US survey measures"

Base units
~~~~~~~~~~

Base units are impossible to define in terms of another unit without
creating a cycle. They represent fundamental physical quantities such as
time, length, temperature, etc.

The name is a shorthand form which is used when showing dimensionality
(for example, the dimensionality of `acceleration` is `m / s^2`), while
the long form is used for display purposes.

New base units should only be added when there is a clear value to doing
so. Examples include radians and bits.

[listing]
?? Equal to the mass of the international prototype of the
?? kilogram. 3rd CGPM (1901, CR, 70).
kg        !kilogram

Quantities
~~~~~~~~~~

Quantities are shown in parentheses whenever rink displays a unit.
They're very helpful for dimensional analysis, as it can be hard to
remember that `kg m^2 / s^2` means the physical quantity of energy.

Quantities are defined similar to units, but the definition starts with
a ? character. Quantities are in a separate namespace from units, so the
only valid names that can be used are the base units as well as other
quantities.

Unlike units, quantities have no numerical value (not even a value of
1 like SI derived units).

[listing]
length                  ? meter
area                    ? length^2

Prefixes
~~~~~~~~

Prefixes allow input of units like `gigabytes`, `megameters`,
`kiloseconds` without needing to explicitly define each one in the units
database. Prefixes are always dimensionless.

These should not be added frequently, only when it's relevant to some
counting system. Examples include power of two byte prefixes (MiB, GiB,
etc.) and Dozenal prefixes.

Prefixes are split into two types, "long" prefixes and "short" prefixes.
Short prefixes should generally only be 1 letter. Typically, short
prefixes are aliases of their corresponding long prefix.

Prefixes are defined similar to other units, but the name ends with a
suffix of `-` (long prefixes) or `--` (short prefixes).

Prefixes use their own namespace. Their definitions can only reference
other prefixes, and not units.

[listing]
kilo-                   1e3
k--                     kilo

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a special `!dependency` pragma that's used in `currency.units`
to declare dependencies on live currency data. This can be used if a new
currency or other live-updating data source is being added.

Guidelines
----------

These guidelines mainly apply when contributing to the upstream
`definitions.units`.

The units database should generally be wrapped so that it fits within
80 columns, for ease of reading. Similarly, units definitions should
generally be aligned vertically using spaces.

Definitions are normally indented to 20 columns, sometimes 25. The
important thing is that adjacent units are aligned. The definitions file
uses spaces for indentation, so keep it consistent instead of mixing
them.

Units whose meaning and origin isn't obvious from their definition
should generally have a documentation comment. This comment can explain
what the unit means, the error bars (if applicable), as well as
providing a citation for its value.

If there are multiple ways to interpret how a unit should be defined,
then mention which interpretation is being used. Unless it's implied by
the name (e.g. `siderealyear`). Examples where units have multiple
interpretations include:

* Customary units may vary by country, and may even vary depending on
  which year in that country. Such as US, British, Australian, and
  International definitions of the foot.
* Units that are inherently fuzzy or represent multiple sources. This
  may include days (calendar, sidereal), years (calendar, sidereal,
  tropical), and others.

Doc comments should be written in US English. They should have sentence
capitalization and full stops, like this guide is written in. Avoid
run-on sentences.

External links should include the protocol part (`https://`, `http://`).
They should be wrapped with angle brackets, like `<https://example.com>`.

Dates should be written in a longhand format such as `July 5th, 1982`.
Do not use ambiguous formats like 2/3/99. It's often sufficient to only
state the year.

Comments in the definitions file are written for the benefit of other
maintainers. They can include explanations for why units are defined a
certain way. They can also state that certain units are part of a group
or set.

All units should be inside of a `!category` / `!endcategory` block.
Category blocks should also enclose comments related to that category,
and the `!category` pragma should immediately follow the last category's
`!endcategory`. This is to allow the file to be easily browsed using Vim
folds. The display name of a category should be in sentence case, and
should be aligned to the 70th column.

Naming
~~~~~~

English names should be lowercase without separators. Words may be
separated by underscores when it adds clarity. Examples include `foot`,
`olympiccubit`, `usgallon`.

If a shorthand is available, it should be added as an alias of the
longer name. Examples include `ft` for `foot`, `B` for `byte`, and `Ω`
for `ohm`.

[listing]
ft                      foot

Some units are most commonly written in a non-Latin script. Use the
non-Latin name as the canonical name, and add an ASCII-based one as an
alias. Examples include `золотник`, `分地`.

Some units are typically written with a symbol. Treat these similar to
the non-Latin script names. Examples include `π` (Pi), `τ` (Tau).

Legacy Unicode symbols should only be used as aliases of more standard
names. This includes uncommon symbols such as `㎒` (Unicode symbol for
Megahertz).

If there are multiple names for a unit, then the one that's most typical
should be the "canonical name". The canonical version should have the
full definition, and the other names should be added as aliases pointing
to the canonical version. Avoid duplicating the definition.

Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Units should be defined in terms of other related units when possible.
The expression you use to define the unit will be visible to the end
user. For example, a foot is defined as `12 inch` rather than as `304.8
mm`. This is because there is already a separate entry for `inch`
defined as `2.54 mm`. When displaying a unit's definition, Rink shows
both the original definition as well as the absolute value. So for
`foot` it shows that it's defined as `12 inch` which equals `304.8
millimeter`.

Rink can represent arbitrary precision rational numbers. The only
limitation is how much memory is available. As a result, irrational
numbers like Pi or Euler's constant should be defined to at least 20
digits.

Universal constants that are measured experimentally should have as many
significant figures as are currently known. For example, if a number is
known to ±0.000003, then it should be listed to 6 digits after the
decimal point.

Sources
~~~~~~~

The best sources are standards documents, such as those published by
CGPM, ISO, NIST.

Fact sheets published by trusted organizations such as NASA, ESA are
also good.

High quality resources and database such as Engineering Toolbox are good
for values that are known empirically.

Books are good for historical units, but it's best to stick to ones
which can be viewed/verified online using sites like Google Books.

Directly citing Wikipedia should be avoided when practical. Instead,
figure out what Wikipedia is citing and use that.

Files
-----

Rink searches for definitions files in these locations:

* `./definitions.units`
* `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/rink/definitions.units`
* `/usr/share/rink/definitions.units`

It will load all of the files it finds. The files can reference
definitions from each other. This can be used for custom definitions
building on top of the default units database.

When live currency fetching is enabled, Rink also looks for a currency
file in these locations:

* `./currency.units`
* `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/rink/currency.units`
* `/usr/share/rink/currency.units`

History
-------

Rink's units database was originally based on GNU Units and inherits
much of its syntax from there.

Notable differences include:

- Removal of `!locale`, `!set`, `!utf8`, and other pragmas not used by Rink.
- Addition of `!category` and `!endcategory`.
- Addition of documentation comments starting with `??`.
- Addition of substances.
