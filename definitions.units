# Brief Philosophy of this file
#
# Most unit definitions are made in terms of integers or simple fractions of
# other definitions.  The typical exceptions are when converting between two
# different unit systems, or the values of measured physical constants.  In
# this file definitions are given in the most natural and revealing way in
# terms of integer factors.
#
# If you make changes be sure to run 'units --check' to check your work.
#
# The file is USA-centric, but there is some modest effort to support other
# countries.  This file is now coded in UTF-8.  To support environments where
# UTF-8 is not available, definitions that require this character set are
# wrapped in !utf8 directives.
#
# When a unit name is used in different countries with the different meanings
# the system should be as follows:
#
# Suppose countries ABC and XYZ both use the "foo".  Then globally define
#
#   ABCfoo  <some value>
#   XYZfoo  <different value>
#
# Then, using the !locale directive, define the "foo" appropriately for each of
# the two countries with a definition like
#
# !locale ABC
#    foo  ABCfoo

# Primitive units.  Any unit defined to contain a '!' character is a      #

# The radian and steradian are defined as dimensionless primitive units.
# The radian is equal to m/m and the steradian to m^2/m^2 so these units are
# dimensionless.  Retaining them as named units is useful because it allows
# clarity in expressions and makes the meaning of unit definitions more clear.
# These units will reduce to 1 in conversions but not for sums of units or for
# arguments to functions.
#

?? The angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in
?? length to the radius of the circle

?? Solid angle which cuts off an area of the surface of the sphere
?? equal to that of a square with sides of length equal to the radius
?? of the sphere

?? Basic unit of information (entropy).  The entropy in bits of a
?? random variable over a finite alphabet is defined to be the sum of
?? -p(i)*log2(p(i)) over the alphabet where p(i) is the probability
?? that the random variable takes on the value i.

?? One international unit of a biological agent is the biological
?? activity equivalent to a standard amount of a substance that
?? represents the agent (its “reference preparation”). Agents that
?? can be measured in international units are generally found in
?? multiple forms (such as Vitamin A) and/or not meaningfully
?? comparable in SI units like moles (such as prolactin).

# Temperature
#
# Two types of units are defined: units for converting temperature differences
# and functions for converting absolute temperatures.  Conversions for
# differences start with "deg" and conversions for absolute temperature start
# with "temp".

# In 1741 Anders Celsius introduced a temperature scale with water boiling at
# 0 degrees and freezing at 100 degrees at standard pressure. After his death
# the fixed points were reversed and the scale was called the centigrade
# scale.  Due to the difficulty of accurately measuring the temperature of
# melting ice at standard pressure, the centigrade scale was replaced in 1954
# by the Celsius scale which is defined by subtracting 273.15 from the
# temperature in Kelvins.  This definition differed slightly from the old
# centigrade definition, but the Kelvin scale depends on the triple point of
# water rather than a melting point, so it can be measured accurately.

# Fahrenheit defined his temperature scale by setting 0 to the coldest
# temperature he could produce in his lab with a salt water solution and by
# setting 96 degrees to body heat.  In Fahrenheit's words:
#
#    Placing the thermometer in a mixture of sal ammoniac or sea
#    salt, ice, and water a point on the scale will be found which
#    is denoted as zero. A second point is obtained if the same
#    mixture is used without salt. Denote this position as 30. A
#    third point, designated as 96, is obtained if the thermometer
#    is placed in the mouth so as to acquire the heat of a healthy
#    man."  (D. G. Fahrenheit, Phil. Trans. (London) 33, 78, 1724)

# Units cannot handle wind chill or heat index because they are two variable
# functions, but they are included here for your edification.  Clearly these
# equations are the result of a model fitting operation.
#
# wind chill index (WCI) a measurement of the combined cooling effect of low
#      air temperature and wind on the human body. The index was first defined
#      by the American Antarctic explorer Paul Siple in 1939. As currently used
#      by U.S. meteorologists, the wind chill index is computed from the
#      temperature T (in °F) and wind speed V (in mi/hr) using the formula:
#          WCI = 0.0817(3.71 sqrt(V) + 5.81 - 0.25V)(T - 91.4) + 91.4.
#      For very low wind speeds, below 4 mi/hr, the WCI is actually higher than
#      the air temperature, but for higher wind speeds it is lower than the air
#      temperature.
#
# heat index (HI or HX) a measure of the combined effect of heat and
#      humidity on the human body. U.S. meteorologists compute the index
#      from the temperature T (in °F) and the relative humidity H (as a
#      value from 0 to 1).
#        HI = -42.379 + 2.04901523 T + 1014.333127 H - 22.475541 TH
#             - .00683783 T^2 - 548.1717 H^2 + 0.122874 T^2 H + 8.5282 T H^2

R_K   25812.8074555 ohm #   The old approach involved maintaining resistances

                        #   based on the Hall effect.  When a current carrying
                        #   ribbon is placed in a magnetic field, a potential
                        #   difference develops across the ribbon.  The ratio
                        #   of the potential difference to the current is
                        #   called the Hall resistance.  Klaus von Klitzing
                        #   discovered in 1980 that the Hall resistance varies
                        #   in discrete jumps when the magnetic field is very

# Note that the Gaussian units are often used in such a way that Coulomb's law
# has the form F= q1 * q2 / r^2.  The constant 1|4*pi*epsilon0 is incorporated
# into the units.  From this, we can get the relation force=charge^2/dist^2.
# This means that the simplification esu^2 = dyne cm^2 can be used to simplify
# units in the Gaussian system, with the curious result that capacitance can be
# measured in cm, resistance in sec/cm, and inductance in sec^2/cm.  These

# Photographic Exposure Value
# This section by Jeff Conrad (jeff_conrad@msn.com)
#
# The Additive system of Photographic EXposure (APEX) proposed in ASA
# PH2.5-1960 was an attempt to simplify exposure determination for people who
# relied on exposure tables rather than exposure meters.  Shortly thereafter,
# nearly all cameras incorporated exposure meters, so the APEX system never
# caught on, but the concept of exposure value remains in use.  Though given as
# 'Ev' in ASA PH2.5-1960, it is now more commonly indicated by 'EV'.  EV is
# related to exposure parameters by
#
#            A^2   LS   ES
#     2^EV = --- = -- = --
#             t    K    C
#
# Where
#     A = Relative aperture (f-number)
#     t = Exposure time in seconds
#     L = Scene luminance in cd/m2
#     E = Scene illuminance in lux
#     S = Arithmetic ISO speed
#     K = Reflected-light meter calibration constant
#     C = Incident-light meter calibration constant
#
# Strictly, an exposure value is a combination of aperture and exposure time,
# but it's also commonly used to indicate luminance (or illuminance).
# Conversion to luminance or illuminance units depends on the ISO speed and the
# meter calibration constant.  Common practice is to use an ISO speed of 100.
# Calibration constants vary among camera and meter manufacturers: Canon,
# Nikon, and Sekonic use a value of 12.5 for reflected-light meters, while
# Kenko (formerly Minolta) and Pentax use a value of 14.  Kenko and Sekonic use
# a value of 250 for incident-light meters with flat receptors.
#
# The values for in-camera meters apply only averaging, weighted-averaging, or
# spot metering--the multi-segment metering incorporated in most current
# cameras uses proprietary algorithms that evaluate many factors related to the
# luminance distribution of what is being metered; they are not amenable to
# simple conversions, and are usually not disclosed by the manufacturers.

# Other Photographic Exposure Conversions
#
# As part of APEX, ASA PH2.5-1960 proposed several logarithmic quantities
# related by
#
#    Ev = Av + Tv = Bv + Sv
#
# where
#  Av = log2(A^2)       Aperture value
#  Tv = log2(1/t)       Time value
#  Sv = log2(N Sx)      Speed value
#  Bv = log2(B S / K)   Luminance ("brightness") value
#  Iv = log2(I S / C)   Illuminance value
#
# and
#  A  = Relative aperture (f-number)
#  t  = Exposure time in seconds
#  Sx = Arithmetic ISO speed in 1/lux s
#  B  = luminance in cd/m2
#  I  = luminance in lux

# The constant N derives from the arcane relationship between arithmetic
# and logarithmic speed given in ASA PH2.5-1960.  That relationship
# apparently was not obvious--so much so that it was thought necessary
# to explain it in PH2.12-1961.  The constant has had several values
# over the years, usually without explanation for the changes.  Although
# APEX had little impact on consumer cameras, it has seen a partial
# resurrection in the Exif standards published by the Camera & Imaging
# Products Association of Japan.

# Units for Photographic Exposure Variables
#
# Practical photography sometimes pays scant attention to units for exposure
# variables.  In particular, the "speed" of the imaging medium is treated as if
# it were dimensionless when it should have units of reciprocal lux seconds;
# this practice works only because "speed" is almost invariably given in
# accordance with international standards (or similar ones used by camera
# manufacturers)--so the assumed units are invariant.  In calculating
# logarithmic quantities--especially the time value Tv and the exposure value
# EV--the units for exposure time ("shutter speed") are often ignored; this
# practice works only because the units of exposure time are assumed to be in
# seconds, and the missing units that make the argument to the logarithmic
# function dimensionless are silently provided.
#
# In keeping with common practice, the definitions that follow treat "speeds"
# as dimensionless, so ISO 100 speed is given simply as '100'.  When
# calculating the logarithmic APEX quantities Av and Tv, the definitions
# provide the missing units, so the times can be given with any appropriate
# units.  For example, giving an exposure time of 1 minute as either '1 min' or
# '60 s' will result in Tv of -5.9068906.
#
# Exposure Value from f-number and Exposure Time
#
# Because nonlinear unit conversions only accept a single quantity,
# there is no direct conversion from f-number and exposure time to
# exposure value EV.  But the EV can be obtained from a combination of
# Av and Tv.  For example, the "sunny 16" rule states that correct
# exposure for a sunlit scene can achieved by using f/16 and an exposure
# time equal to the reciprocal of the ISO speed in seconds; this can be
# calculated as
#
#    ~Av(16) + ~Tv(1|100 s),
#
# which gives 14.643856.  These conversions may be combined with the
# ev100 conversion:
#
#    ev100(~Av(16) + ~Tv(1|100 s))
#
# to yield the assumed average scene luminance of 3200 cd/m^2.

# Astronomical time measurements
#
# Astronomical time measurement is a complicated matter.  The length of the
# true day at a given place can be 21 seconds less than 24 hours or 30 seconds
# over 24 hours.  The two main reasons for this are the varying speed of the
# earth in its elliptical orbit and the fact that the sun moves on the ecliptic
# instead of along the celestial equator.  To devise a workable system for time
# measurement, Simon Newcomb (1835-1909) used a fictitious "mean sun".
# Consider a first fictitious sun traveling along the ecliptic at a constant
# speed and coinciding with the true sun at perigee and apogee.  Then
# considering a second fictitious sun traveling along the celestial equator at
# a constant speed and coinciding with the first fictitious sun at the
# equinoxes.  The second fictitious sun is the "mean sun".  From this equations
# can be written out to determine the length of the mean day, and the tropical
# year.  The length of the second was determined based on the tropical year
# from such a calculation and was officially used from 1960-1967 until atomic
# clocks replaced astronomical measurements for a standard of time.  All of the
# values below give the mean time for the specified interval.
#
# See "Mathematical Astronomy Morsels" by Jean Meeus for more details
# and a description of how to compute the correction to mean time.

# Many astronomical values can be measured most accurately in a system of units
# using the astronomical unit and the mass of the sun as base units.  The
# uncertainty in the gravitational constant makes conversion to SI units
# significantly less accurate.

# The astronomical unit was defined to be the length of the of the semimajor
# axis of a massless object with the same year as the earth.  With such a
# definition in force, and with the mass of the sun set equal to one, Kepler's
# third law can be used to solve for the value of the gravitational constant.

# Kepler's third law says that (2 pi / T)^2 a^3 = G M where T is the orbital
# period, a is the size of the semimajor axis, G is the gravitational constant
# and M is the mass.  With M = 1 and T and a chosen for the earth's orbit, we
# find sqrt(G) = (2 pi / T) sqrt(AU^3).  This constant is called the Gaussian
# gravitational constant, apparently because Gauss originally did the
# calculations.  However, when the original calculation was done, the value
# for the length of the earth's year was inaccurate.  The value used is called
# the Gaussian year.  Changing the astronomical unit to bring it into
# agreement with more accurate values for the year would have invalidated a
# lot of previous work, so instead the astronomical unit has been kept equal
# to this original value.  This is accomplished by using a standard value for
# the Gaussian gravitational constant.  This constant is called k.

# linear measure

# The US Metric Law of 1866 legalized the metric system in the USA and
# defined the meter in terms of the British system with the exact
# 1 meter = 39.37 inches.  On April 5, 1893 Thomas Corwin Mendenhall,
# Superintendent of Weights and Measures, decided, in what has become
# known as the "Mendenhall Order" that the meter and kilogram would be the
# fundamental standards in the USA.  The definition from 1866 was turned
# around to give an exact definition of the yard as 3600|3937 meters This
# definition was used until July of 1959 when the definition was changed
# to bring the US and other English-speaking countries into agreement; the
# Canadian value of 1 yard = 0.9144 meter (exactly) was chosen because it
# was approximately halfway between the British and US values; it had the
# added advantage of making 1 inch = 25.4 mm (exactly).  Since 1959, the
# "international" foot has been exactly 0.3048 meters.  At the same time,
# it was decided that any data expressed in feet derived from geodetic
# surveys within the US would continue to use the old definition and call
# the old unit the "survey foot." The US continues to define the statute
# mile, furlong, chain, rod, link, and fathom in terms of the US survey
# foot.

# The length measure in the UK was defined by a bronze bar manufactured in
# 1844.  Various conversions were sanctioned for convenience at different
# times, which makes conversions before 1963 a confusing matter.  Apparently
# previous conversions were never explicitly revoked.  Four different
# conversion factors appear below.  Multiply them times an imperial length
# units as desired.  The Weights and Measures Act of 1963 switched the UK away
# from their bronze standard and onto a definition of the yard in terms of the
# meter.  This happened after an international agreement in 1959 to align the
# world's measurement systems.

# In 1922, Seers, Jolly and
#   Johnson found the yard to be
#   0.91439841 meters.
#   Used starting in the 1930's.

# Density of a sugar syrup is frequently measured in candy making procedures.
# In the USA the boiling point of the syrup is measured.  Some recipes instead
# specify the density using degrees Baume.  Conversion between degrees Baume
# and the boiling point measure has proved elusive.  This table appeared in one

# Using the brix table we can use this to produce a mapping from boiling point
# to density which makes all of the units interconvertible.  Because the brix
# table stops at 95 this approach works up to a boiling point elevation of 39 K
# or a boiling point of 139 C / 282 F, which is the "soft crack" stage in candy
# making.  The "hard crack" stage continues up to 310 F.

# Heat Transfer
#
# Thermal conductivity, K, measures the rate of heat transfer across
# a material.  The heat transfered is
#     Q = K dT A t / L
# where dT is the temperature difference across the material, A is the
# cross sectional area, t is the time, and L is the length (thickness).
# Thermal conductivity is a material property.

thermal_conductivity    ? power / area (temperature_difference/length)
thermal_resistivity     ? 1/thermal_conductivity

# Thermal conductance is the rate at which heat flows across a given
# object, so the area and thickness have been fixed.  It depends on
# the size of the object and is hence not a material property.

thermal_conductance     ? power / temperature_difference
thermal_resistance      ? 1/thermal_conductance

# Thermal admittance is the rate of heat flow per area across an
# object whose thickness has been fixed.  Its reciprocal, thermal
# insulation, is used to for measuring the heat transfer per area
# of sheets of insulation or cloth that are of specified thickness.

# The bel was defined by engineers of Bell Laboratories to describe the
# reduction in audio level over a length of one mile. It was originally
# called the transmission unit (TU) but was renamed around 1923 to honor
# Alexander Graham Bell. The bel proved inconveniently large so the decibel
# has become more common.  The decibel is dimensionless since it reports a
# ratio, but it is used in various contexts to report a signal's power
# relative to some reference level.

# The metric paper sizes are defined so that if a sheet is cut in half
# along the short direction, the result is two sheets which are
# similar to the original sheet.  This means that for any metric size,
# the long side is close to sqrt(2) times the length of the short
# side.  Each series of sizes is generated by repeated cuts in half,

# gsm (Grams per Square Meter), a sane, metric paper weight measure

gsm                     grams / meter^2

# In the USA, a collection of crazy historical paper measures are used.  Paper
# is measured as a weight of a ream of that particular type of paper.  This is
# sometimes called the "substance" or "basis" (as in "substance 20" paper).
# The standard sheet size or "basis size" varies depending on the type of
# paper.  As a result, 20 pound bond paper and 50 pound text paper are actually
# about the same weight.  The different sheet sizes were historically the most
# convenient for printing or folding in the different applications.  These
# different basis weights are standards maintained by American Society for
# Testing Materials (ASTM) and the American Forest and Paper Association
# (AF&PA).

# Gauge pressure functions
#
# Gauge pressure is measured relative to atmospheric pressure.  In the English
# system, where pressure is often given in pounds per square inch, gauge
# pressure is often indicated by 'psig' to distinguish it from absolute
# pressure, often indicated by 'psia'.  At the standard atmospheric pressure
# of 14.696 psia, a gauge pressure of 0 psig is an absolute pressure of 14.696
# psia; an automobile tire inflated to 31 psig has an absolute pressure of
# 45.696 psia.
#
# With gaugepressure(), the units must be specified (e.g., gaugepressure(1.5
# bar)); with psig(), the units are taken as psi, so the example above of tire
# pressure could be given as psig(31).
#
# If the normal elevation is significantly different from sea level, change
# Patm appropriately, and adjust the lower domain limit on the gaugepressure
# definition.

# Wire Gauge
#
# This area is a nightmare with huge charts of wire gauge diameters
# that usually have no clear origin.  There are at least 5 competing wire gauge
# systems to add to the confusion.  The use of wire gauge is related to the
# manufacturing method: a metal rod is heated and drawn through a hole.  The
# size change can't be too big.  To get smaller wires, the process is repeated
# with a series of smaller holes.  Generally larger gauges mean smaller wires.
# The gauges often have values such as "00" and "000" which are larger sizes
# than simply "0" gauge.  In the tables that appear below, these gauges must be
# specified as negative numbers (e.g. "00" is -1, "000" is -2, etc).
# Alternatively, you can use the following units:

# American Wire Gauge (AWG) or Brown & Sharpe Gauge appears to be the most
# important gauge. ASTM B-258 specifies that this gauge is based on geometric
# interpolation between gauge 0000, which is 0.46 inches exactly, and gauge 36
# which is 0.005 inches exactly.  Therefore, the diameter in inches of a wire
# is given by the formula 1|200 92^((36-g)/39).  Note that 92^(1/39) is close
# to 2^(1/6), so diameter is approximately halved for every 6 gauges.  For the
# repeated zero values, use negative numbers in the formula.  The same document
# also specifies rounding rules which seem to be ignored by makers of tables.
# Gauges up to 44 are to be specified with up to 4 significant figures, but no
# closer than 0.0001 inch.  Gauges from 44 to 56 are to be rounded to the
# nearest 0.00001 inch.
#
# In addition to being used to measure wire thickness, this gauge is used to
# measure the thickness of sheets of aluminum, copper, and most metals other
# than steel, iron and zinc.

# The following is from the Appendix to ASTM B 258
#
#    For example, in U.S. gage, the standard for sheet metal is based on the
#    weight of the metal, not on the thickness. 16-gage is listed as
#    approximately .0625 inch thick and 40 ounces per square foot (the original
#    standard was based on wrought iron at .2778 pounds per cubic inch; steel
#    has almost entirely superseded wrought iron for sheet use, at .2833 pounds
#    per cubic inch). Smaller numbers refer to greater thickness. There is no
#    formula for converting gage to thickness or weight.
#
# It's rather unclear from the passage above whether the plate gauge values are
# therefore wrong if steel is being used.  Reference [15] states that steel is
# in fact measured using this gauge (under the name Manufacturers' Standard
# Gauge) with a density of 501.84 lb/ft3 = 0.2904 lb/in3 used for steel.
# But this doesn't seem to be the correct density of steel (.2833 lb/in3 is
# closer).
#
# This gauge was established in 1893 for purposes of taxation.

# Abrasive grit size
#
# Standards governing abrasive grit sizes are complicated, specifying
# fractions of particles that are passed or retained by different mesh
# sizes.  As a result, it is not possible to make precise comparisons
# of different grit standards.  The tables below allow the
# determination of rough equivlants by using median particle size.
#
# Standards in the USA are determined by the Unified Abrasives
# Manufacturers' Association (UAMA), which resulted from the merger of
# several previous organizations.  One of the old organizations was
# CAMI (Coated Abrasives Manufacturers' Institute).
#
# UAMA has a web page with plots showing abrasive particle ranges for
# various different grits and comparisons between standards.
#
# http://www.uama.org/Abrasives101/101Standards.html
#
# Abrasives are grouped into "bonded" abrasives for use with grinding
# wheels and "coated" abrasives for sandpapers and abrasive films.
# The industry uses different grit standards for these two
# categories.
#
# Another division is between "macrogrits", grits below 240 and
# "microgrits", which are above 240.  Standards differ, as do methods
# for determining particle size.  In the USA, ANSI B74.12 is the
# standard governing macrogrits.  ANSI B74.10 covers bonded microgrit
# abrasives, and ANSI B74.18 covers coated microgrit abrasives.  It
# appears that the coated standard is identical to the bonded standard
# for grits up through 600 but then diverges significantly.
#
# European grit sizes are determined by the Federation of European
# Producers of Abrasives.  http://www.fepa-abrasives.org
#
# They give two standards, the "F" grit for bonded abrasives and the
# "P" grit for coated abrasives.  This data is taken directly from
# their web page.

# FEPA P grit for coated abrasives is commonly seen on sandpaper in
# the USA where the paper will be marked P600, for example.  FEPA P
# grits are said to be more tightly constrained than comparable ANSI
# grits so that the particles are more uniform in size and hence give
# a better finish.

# Like the bonded grit, the coated macrogrits below 240 are taken from the
# FEPA F table.  Data above this is from the UAMA site.  Note that the coated
# and bonded standards are evidently the same from 240 up to 600 grit, but
# starting at 800 grit, the coated standard diverges.  The data from UAMA show
# that 800 grit coated has an average size slightly larger than the average
# size of 600 grit coated/bonded.  However, the 800 grit has a significantly
# smaller particle size variation.
#
# Because of this non-monotonicity from 600 grit to 800 grit this definition
# produces a warning about the lack of a unique inverse.

# Ring size. All ring sizes are given as the circumference of the ring.
#

# USA ring sizes.  Several slightly different definitions seem to be in
# circulation.  According to [15], the interior diameter of size n ring in
# inches is 0.32 n + 0.458 for n ranging from 3 to 13.5 by steps of 0.5.  The
# size 2 ring is inconsistently 0.538in and no 2.5 size is listed.
#
# However, other sources list 0.455 + 0.0326 n and 0.4525 + 0.0324 n as the
# diameter and list no special case for size 2.  (Or alternatively they are
# 1.43 + .102 n and 1.4216+.1018 n for measuring circumference in inches.)  One
# reference claimed that the original system was that each size was 1|10 inch
# circumference, but that source doesn't have an explanation for the modern
# system which is somewhat different.

#ringsize(n) units=[1;in] domain=[2,) range=[1.6252,) \
#            (1.4216+.1018 n) in ; (ringsize/in + (-1.4216))/.1018

# Old practice in the UK measured rings using the "Wheatsheaf gauge" with sizes
# specified alphabetically and based on the ring inside diameter in steps of
# 1|64 inch.  This system was replaced in 1987 by British Standard 6820 which
# specifies sizes based on circumference.  Each size is 1.25 mm different from
# the preceding size.  The baseline is size C which is 40 mm circumference.
# The new sizes are close to the old ones.  Sometimes it's necessary to go
# beyond size Z to Z+1, Z+2, etc.

# Traditional Japanese units (shakkanhou)
#
# The traditional system of weights and measures is called shakkanhou from the
# shaku and the ken.  Japan accepted SI units in 1891 and legalized conversions
# to the traditional system.  In 1909 the inch-pound system was also legalized,
# so Japan had three legally approved systems.  A change to the metric system
# started in 1921 but there was a lot of resistance.  The Measurement Law of
# October 1999 prohibits sales in anything but SI units.  However, the old
# units still live on in construction and as the basis for paper sizes of books
# and tools used for handicrafts.
#
# Note that units below use the Hepburn romanization system.  Some other
# systems would render "mou", "jou", and "chou" as "mo", "jo" and "cho".

# Japanese Proportions.  These are still in everyday use.  They also
# get used as units to represent the proportion of the standard unit.

# Japanese architecture is based on a "standard" size of tatami mat.
# Room sizes today are given in number of tatami, and this number
# determines the spacing between colums and hence sizes of sliding
# doors and paper screens.  However, every region has its own slightly
# different tatami size.  Edoma, used in and around Tokyo and
# Hokkaido, is becoming a nationwide standard.  Kyouma is used around
# Kyoto, Osaka and Kyuushu, and Chuukyouma is used around Nagoya.
# Note that the tatami all have the aspect ratio 2:1 so that the mats
# can tile the room with some of them turned 90 degrees.

# Celestial bodies

# Sidereal years from http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/phys_props_planets.html.  Data
# was updated in May 2001 based on the 1992 Explanatory Supplement to the
# Astronomical Almanac and the mean longitude rates.  Apparently the table of
# years in that reference is incorrect.

# The following are masses for planetary systems, not just the planet itself.
# The comments give the uncertainty in the denominators.  As noted above,
# masses are given relative to the solarmass because this is more accurate.
# The conversion to SI is uncertain because of uncertainty in G, the
# gravitational constant.
#
# Values are from http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/astro_constants.html

# Mean radius from http://ssd.jpl.nsaa.gov/phys_props_planets.html which in
# turn cites Global Earth Physics by CF Yoder, 1995.

#
# Atomic weights.  The atomic weight of an element is the ratio of the mass of
# a mole of the element to 1|12 of a mole of Carbon 12.  The Standard Atomic
# Weights apply to the elements as they occur naturally on earth.  Elements
# which do not occur naturally or which occur with wide isotopic variability do
# not have Standard Atomic Weights.  For these elements, the atomic weight is
# based on the longest lived isotope, as marked in the comments.  In some
# cases, the comment for these entries also gives a number which is an atomic
# weight for a different isotope that may be of more interest than the longest
# lived isotope.
