// Prefixes
//   Prefixes are defined with the symbol :- to indicate a prefix which cannot
//  stand by itself (must precede a unit name without intervening spaces)
//  or with the symbol ::- for a prefix which can be either attached to a unit
//  or defines a standalone unit.  For example, you may want to allow "giga"
//  to work as a prefix or as a stand-alone synonym for a billion, (generally
//  you do this just so someone can look up what it means if they forget,) 
//  in which case you would use the ::- operator.  If you have a prefix like 
//  "m" for milli, which you don't want to allow to stand alone, use the :-
//  operator. 
//   
//   A number specified like "1ee20" with integers for the mantissa and the 
//   exponent are treated as an exact integer, that is, 1ee20 represents 
//   the exact integer 1 followed by 20 zeroes.  ("ee" can be thought to 
//   stand for "exact exponent".)  This is in contrast to the more standard
//   "1e20" which is treated as an inexact floating-point number.

// SI (International System of Units) base dimensions

// The special operator =!= defines a new base dimension.  This is a dimension
// that is orthogonal to all other base dimensions.  For example, the SI 
// defines base dimensions for length (m), mass (kg), time (s), etc., and other
// unit types are defined in terms of these base dimensions.  The left-hand-
// side is the human-readable name of the base dimension (e.g. "length" or
// "mass") and the right-hand-side is the fundamental unit of that dimension
// (e.g. "m" for length or "kg" for mass)

length    =!= m   // Length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum
meter :=  m     //   during 1/299792458 seconds (exactly.)

                //  Alan's notes:

                 //   have to be able to turn it into a dollar if you want

                 // If you want to define your own base currency, and you want

                //   fundamental dimension that is not required to make an

                //  
                //   It is thus just essentially a dimensionless number and it
                //   introduces artificiality to make it its own fundamental

                //   easily be a derived dimensionless unit whose value is

                //   until 1971.)  It's just a "practical" unit to give
                //   a "practical" size, not because it represents a new 
                //   fundamental dimension of measurement.  
                // 
                //   As a practical matter, what it does is ties a more-easily
                //   (?) measurable quantity, that of a mass,

                //   Avogadro's number, one that may have been hard to count.
                //
                //   It's also odd in that it's the only definition that says
                //   it's incomplete by itself and that you must specify
                //   a mole of some specific particle or molecule.  Yet no

                //   things.  You can't have two different definitions of a
                //   meter, or a candela.  And even the CIE notes that

                //    of weighting, but this problem is currently being

                //   Update:  On April 2, 2007, the BIPM and the CIE finally
                //   signed a vague agreement that they want to work more
                //   closely and hints at a future hope that there will
                //   someday be a single, authoritative definition accepted
                //   and mandated across both bodies.  The agreement says that
                //   the expertise for defining a standard curve will fall 
                //   under the auspices of the CIE, as "the CIE may decide to
                //   standardize."  (No certainty nor timeline; just "maybe
                //   it'll happen someday.")  Hopefully this will be followed
                //   by an official pronouncement of the BIPM that a certain
                //   curve is mandated for use in defining the candela.  And
                //   hopefully it will be better than the old 1931 curve.
                //   And hopefully the BIPM will, you know, maybe PUBLISH it
                //   somewhere instead of pointing at the root of another web
                //   site and saying "it's one of the documents hidden
                //   somewhere over there but we're not going to tell you
                //   which and we want to see your face when you realize you
                //   have to buy random documents at a hundred dollars a pop."
                //
                //   Don't hold your breath, though.  It's been 30 years since

// Alan's Editorializing:  Here is YET ANOTHER place where the SI made a
// really stupid definition.  Let's follow their chain of definitions, shall
// we, and see how it leads to absolutely ridiculous results.

// The Hz is currently defined simply as inverse seconds. (1/s).
//  See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html
//
// The base unit of frequency in the SI *used* to be "cycles per second".  
// This was fine and good.  However, in 1960, the BIPM made the 
// change to make the fundamental unit of frequency to
// be "Hz" which they defined as inverse seconds (without qualification.) 
//
// Then, in 1974, they changed the radian from its own base unit in the SI
// to be a dimensionless number, which it indeed is (it's a length divided by 
// a length.)  That change was correct and good in itself.
//
// However, the definition of the Hz was *not* corrected at the same
// time that the radian was changed.  Thus, we have the conflicting SI 
// definition of the radian as the dimensionless number 1 (without 
// qualification) and Hz as 1/s.  (Without qualification.)
//
// This means that, if you follow the rules of the SI,
// 1 Hz = 1/s = 1 radian/s which is simply inconsistent and violates basic
// ideas of sinusoidal motion, and is simply a stupid definition.
// The entire rest of the world, up until that point, knew that 1 Hz needs to 
// be equal to *2 pi* radians/s or be changed to mean *cycles/second* for 
// these to be reconcilable.  If you use "Hz" to mean cycles/second, say,
// in sinusoidal motion, as the world has done for a century, know that the SI
// made all your calculations wrong.  A couple of times, in different ways.
//
// This gives the wonderful situation that the SI's Hz-vs-radian/s definitions
// have meant completely different things in the timeperiods:
//
// * pre-1960
// * 1960 to 1974
// * post-1974
//
//
// Thus, anyone trying to mix the SI definitions for Hz and angular
// frequencies (e.g. radians/s) will get utterly wrong answers that don't
// match basic mathematical reality, nor match any way that Hz was ever used
// for describing, say, sinusoidal motion.
//
// Beware the SI's broken definition
// of Hz.  You should treat the radian as being correct, as a fundamental
// dimensionless property of the universe that falls out of pure math like
// the Taylor series for sin[x], and you should treat the Hz as being a 
// fundamental property of incompetence by committee.
//
// One could consider the CGPM in 1960 to have made the original mistake, 
// re-defining Hz in a way that did not reflect its meaning up to that point,
// or the CGPM in 1974 to have made the absolutely huge mistake that made 
// the whole system inconsistent and wrong, and clearly broke the definition
// of Hz-vs-radian/s used everywhere in the world, turning it into a broken,
// self-contradictory mess that it is now.
//
// Either way, if I ever develop a time machine, I'm going to go back and
// knock both groups' heads together.  At a frequency of about 1 Hz.  Or
// better yet, strap them to a wheel and tell them I'm going to spin one group
// at a frequency of 1 Hz, and the other at 1 radian/s and let them try to
// figure out which one of those stupid inconsistent definitions means what.
// Hint:  It'll depend on which time period I do it in, I guess, thanks to
// their useless inconsistent definition changes.
//
// It's as if this bunch of geniuses took a well-understood term like "day"
// and redefined it to mean "60 minutes".  It simply breaks every historical
// use, and present use, and just causes confusion and a blatant source of
// error.
//
// Frink tries to follow the most authoritative international standards bodies
// for all of its definitions.  However, when authoritative international
// standards bodies change definitions silently to make them inconsistent
// with their previous definitions and with centuries of fundamental
// mathematical definitions, then Frink would be negligent to not try to
// warn you of the huge incompatibilities in the strongest possible way.
//
// One of Frink's design goals is: "When in doubt, be pedantic.  Explain to
// people how their calculation might be problematic and help them to write
// it in a more standardized, unambiguous way."  The re-definition of the Hz
// is an actively damaging change that has to be warned about in the strongest
// possible terms.
//
// In summary:  Frink grudgingly follows the SI's ridiculous, broken definition
// of "Hz".  You should not use "Hz".  The SI's definition of Hz should be
// considered harmful and broken.  Instead, if you're talking about circular
// or sinusoidal motion, use terms like "cycles/sec" "revolutions/s",
// "rpm", "rps", "circle/min", etc. and Frink will do the right thing because 
// it doesn't involve the stupid SI definition that doesn't match what any
// human knows about sinusoidal motion.
//
// WARNING:  Use of "Hz" will cause communication problems, errors, and make
// one party or another look insane in the eyes of the other.
//
// In other words, if you use the Hz in the way it's currently defined by the 
// SI, as equivalent to 1 radian/s, you can point to the SI definitions and
// prove that you follow their definitions precisely.  And your physics 
// teacher will *still* fail you and your clients will think you're completely
// incompetent because 1 Hz = 2 pi radians/s.  And it has for centuries.
// You are both simultaneously both right and both wrong.  
// You cannot win.
// You are perfectly right.  You are perfectly wrong.  You look dumb and
// unreasonable.  The person arguing the opposite looks dumb and unreasonable.
//
// Hz == YOU CANNOT WIN

    /*  From Department of the Army's authoritative study: "Effects of
        Nuclear Weapons", footnote 3 to section 1.45, available at:
        http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/

       "The majority of the experimental and theoretical values of the
       explosive energy released by TNT range from 900 to 1,100 calories per
       gram.  At one time, there was some uncertainty as to whether the term
       "kiloton" of TNT referred to a short kiloton (2 x 10^6 pounds), a
       metric kiloton (2.205 x 10^6 pounds), or a long kiloton (2.24 x 10^6
       pounds).  In order to avoid ambiguity, it was agreed that the term
       "kiloton" would refer to the release of 10^12 calories of explosive
       energy.  This is equivalent to 1 short kiloton of TNT if the energy
       release is 1,102 calories per gram or to 1 long kiloton if the energy
       is 984 calories per gram of TNT."

       So, evidently they don't quite specify which ton is required, but
       rather defined the phrase "kiloton" (of TNT is implied) as a new unit
       that just means 10^12 calories.  It's a measure of energy, not an
       energy density, and to be rigorous, we shouldn't divide by the mass.
       But as a practical matter, we will want to divide by mass.  Of all the
       different types of tons available, the one that matches this definition
       the closest shows that the short ton (2000 lb) was almost certainly
       originally intended, and most closely matches this definition. 

       NIST Special Publication 811 lists the definition:
       http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB8.html#T

       ton of TNT (energy equivalent) = 4.184e9 J

       However, this is not clear as to which kind of ton is intended.  All of
       the other tons listed in that section are identified, but not this
       case.  (Yet another problem with SP811 that I'll have to report.)  If
       we assume that this is also for a short ton, it matches the definition
       from the Army study to more than 3 decimal places, so we'll assume that
       the short ton is intended.  Since this citation is so vague, the Army
       study has to be taken as more authoritative until SP811 is fixed or
       another more authoritative citation can be found. */

// Wire gauge: this area is a nightmare with huge charts of wire gauge
// diameters that usually have no clear origin.  There are at least 5 competing
// wire gauge systems to add to the confusion.

// The use of wire gauge is related to the manufacturing method: a metal rod is
// heated and drawn through a hole.  The size change can't be too big.  To get
// smaller wires, the process is repeated with a series of smaller holes.  

// American Wire Gauge (AWG) or Brown & Sharpe Gauge appears to be the most
// important gauge. ASTM B-258 specifies that this gauge is based on geometric
// interpolation between gauge 0000, which is 0.46 inches exactly, and gauge 36
// which is 0.005 inches exactly.  Therefore, the diameter in inches of a wire
// is given by the formula 1/200 92^((36-g)/39).  Note that 92^(1/39) is close
// to 2^(1/6), so diameter is approximately halved for every 6 gauges.  For the
// repeated zero values, use negative numbers in the formula.  The same document
// also specifies rounding rules which seem to be ignored by makers of tables.
// Gauges up to 44 are to be specified with up to 4 significant figures, but no
// closer than 0.0001 inch.  Gauges from 44 to 56 are to be rounded to the
// nearest 0.00001 inch.  The table below gives 4 significant figures for all
// gauges.
//
// In addition to being used to measure wire thickness, this gauge is used to
// measure the thickness of sheets of aluminum, copper, and most metals other
// than steel, iron and zinc.

// The numbers below are DIAMETERS.

// The following is from the Appendix to ASTM B 258
// 
// For example, in U.S. gage, the standard for sheet metal is based on the
// weight of the metal, not on the thickness. 16-gage is listed as approximately
// .0625 inch thick and 40 ounces per square foot (the original standard was
// based on wrought iron at .2778 pounds per cubic inch; steel has almost
// entirely superseded wrought iron for sheet use, at .2833 pounds per cubic
// inch). Smaller numbers refer to greater thickness. There is no formula for
// converting gage to thickness or weight.
// 
// It's rather unclear from the passage above whether the plate gauge values are
// therefore wrong if steel is being used.  Reference [15] states that steel is
// in fact measured using this gauge (under the name Manufacturers' Standard
// Gauge) with a density of 501.84 lb/ft3 = 0.2904 lb/in3 used for steel.
// But this doesn't seem to be the correct density of steel (.2833 lb/in3 is
// closer), and nobody else lists these values.  
//
// This gauge was established in 1893 for purposes of taxation.

// Old practice in the UK measured rings using the "Wheatsheaf gauge" with sizes
// specified alphabetically and based on the ring inside diameter in steps of
// 1/64 inch.  This system was replaced in 1987 by British Standard 6820 which
// specifies sizes based on circumference.  Each size is 1.25 mm different from
// the preceding size.  The baseline is size C which is 40 mm circumference.
// The new sizes are close to the old ones.  Sometimes it's necessary to go
// beyond size Z to Z+1, Z+2, etc.
