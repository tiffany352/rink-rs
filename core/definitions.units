# Brief Philosophy of this file
#
# Most unit definitions are made in terms of integers or simple fractions of
# other definitions.  The typical exceptions are when converting between two
# different unit systems, or the values of measured physical constants.  In
# this file definitions are given in the most natural and revealing way in
# terms of integer factors.
#
# If you make changes be sure to run 'units --check' to check your work.
#
# The file is USA-centric, but there is some modest effort to support other
# countries.  This file is now coded in UTF-8.  To support environments where
# UTF-8 is not available, definitions that require this character set are
# wrapped in !utf8 directives.
#
# When a unit name is used in different countries with the different meanings
# the system should be as follows:
#
# Suppose countries ABC and XYZ both use the "foo".  Then globally define
#
#   ABCfoo  <some value>
#   XYZfoo  <different value>
#
# Then, using the !locale directive, define the "foo" appropriately for each of
# the two countries with a definition like
#
# !locale ABC
#    foo  ABCfoo
# !endlocale

# Primitive units.  Any unit defined to contain a '!' character is a      #
# primitive unit which will not be reduced any further.  All units should #
# reduce to primitive units.                                              #

m         !meter

?? The constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel
?? conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular
?? cross-section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would produce
?? between those conductors a force equal to 2e-7 newton per meter of
?? length. 9th CGPM (1948).

#
# The radian and steradian are defined as dimensionless primitive units.
# The radian is equal to m/m and the steradian to m^2/m^2 so these units are
# dimensionless.  Retaining them as named units is useful because it allows
# clarity in expressions and makes the meaning of unit definitions more clear.
# These units will reduce to 1 in conversions but not for sums of units or for
# arguments to functions.
#

?? The angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in
?? length to the radius of the circle
radian    !

?? Solid angle which cuts off an area of the surface of the sphere
?? equal to that of a square with sides of length equal to the radius
?? of the sphere
sr        !steradian

#
# Some primitive non-SI units
#

?? Basic unit of information (entropy).  The entropy in bits of a
?? random variable over a finite alphabet is defined to be the sum of
?? -p(i)*log2(p(i)) over the alphabet where p(i) is the probability
?? that the random variable takes on the value i.
bit       !

?? One international unit of a biological agent is the biological
?? activity equivalent to a standard amount of a substance that
?? represents the agent (its “reference preparation”). Agents that
?? can be measured in international units are generally found in
?? multiple forms (such as Vitamin A) and/or not meaningfully
?? comparable in SI units like moles (such as prolactin).

# In 1741 Anders Celsius introduced a temperature scale with water boiling at
# 0 degrees and freezing at 100 degrees at standard pressure. After his death
# the fixed points were reversed and the scale was called the centigrade
# scale.  Due to the difficulty of accurately measuring the temperature of
# melting ice at standard pressure, the centigrade scale was replaced in 1954
# by the Celsius scale which is defined by subtracting 273.15 from the
# temperature in Kelvins.  This definition differed slightly from the old
# centigrade definition, but the Kelvin scale depends on the triple point of
# water rather than a melting point, so it can be measured accurately.

# Fahrenheit defined his temperature scale by setting 0 to the coldest
# temperature he could produce in his lab with a salt water solution and by
# setting 96 degrees to body heat.  In Fahrenheit's words:
#
#    Placing the thermometer in a mixture of sal ammoniac or sea
#    salt, ice, and water a point on the scale will be found which
#    is denoted as zero. A second point is obtained if the same
#    mixture is used without salt. Denote this position as 30. A
#    third point, designated as 96, is obtained if the thermometer
#    is placed in the mouth so as to acquire the heat of a healthy
#    man."  (D. G. Fahrenheit, Phil. Trans. (London) 33, 78, 1724)

                        #   the volt.  The Josephson effect occurs when two
                        #   superconductors are separated by a thin insulating
                        #   layer.  A "supercurrent" flows across the insulator

                        #   can be very accurately measured.  The Josephson
                        #   constant K_J, which is equal to 2e/h, relates the
                        #   measured frequency to the potential.  Two values

R_K   25812.8074555 ohm #   The old approach involved maintaining resistances

                        #   based on the Hall effect.  When a current carrying
                        #   ribbon is placed in a magnetic field, a potential
                        #   difference develops across the ribbon.  The ratio
                        #   of the potential difference to the current is
                        #   called the Hall resistance.  Klaus von Klitzing
                        #   discovered in 1980 that the Hall resistance varies
                        #   in discrete jumps when the magnetic field is very
                        #   large and the temperature very low.  This enables

# Photographic Exposure Value
# This section by Jeff Conrad (jeff_conrad@msn.com)
#
# The Additive system of Photographic EXposure (APEX) proposed in ASA
# PH2.5-1960 was an attempt to simplify exposure determination for people who
# relied on exposure tables rather than exposure meters.  Shortly thereafter,
# nearly all cameras incorporated exposure meters, so the APEX system never
# caught on, but the concept of exposure value remains in use.  Though given as
# 'Ev' in ASA PH2.5-1960, it is now more commonly indicated by 'EV'.  EV is
# related to exposure parameters by
#
#            A^2   LS   ES
#     2^EV = --- = -- = --
#             t    K    C
#
# Where
#     A = Relative aperture (f-number)
#     t = Exposure time in seconds
#     L = Scene luminance in cd/m2
#     E = Scene illuminance in lux
#     S = Arithmetic ISO speed
#     K = Reflected-light meter calibration constant
#     C = Incident-light meter calibration constant
#
# Strictly, an exposure value is a combination of aperture and exposure time,
# but it's also commonly used to indicate luminance (or illuminance).
# Conversion to luminance or illuminance units depends on the ISO speed and the
# meter calibration constant.  Common practice is to use an ISO speed of 100.
# Calibration constants vary among camera and meter manufacturers: Canon,

# Other Photographic Exposure Conversions
#
# As part of APEX, ASA PH2.5-1960 proposed several logarithmic quantities
# related by
#
#    Ev = Av + Tv = Bv + Sv
#
# where
#  Av = log2(A^2)       Aperture value
#  Tv = log2(1/t)       Time value
#  Sv = log2(N Sx)      Speed value
#  Bv = log2(B S / K)   Luminance ("brightness") value
#  Iv = log2(I S / C)   Illuminance value
#
# and
#  A  = Relative aperture (f-number)
#  t  = Exposure time in seconds
#  Sx = Arithmetic ISO speed in 1/lux s
#  B  = luminance in cd/m2
#  I  = luminance in lux

# The constant N derives from the arcane relationship between arithmetic
# and logarithmic speed given in ASA PH2.5-1960.  That relationship
# apparently was not obvious--so much so that it was thought necessary
# to explain it in PH2.12-1961.  The constant has had several values
# over the years, usually without explanation for the changes.  Although
# APEX had little impact on consumer cameras, it has seen a partial
# resurrection in the Exif standards published by the Camera & Imaging
# Products Association of Japan.

# Units for Photographic Exposure Variables
#
# Practical photography sometimes pays scant attention to units for exposure
# variables.  In particular, the "speed" of the imaging medium is treated as if
# it were dimensionless when it should have units of reciprocal lux seconds;
# this practice works only because "speed" is almost invariably given in
# accordance with international standards (or similar ones used by camera
# manufacturers)--so the assumed units are invariant.  In calculating
# logarithmic quantities--especially the time value Tv and the exposure value
# EV--the units for exposure time ("shutter speed") are often ignored; this
# practice works only because the units of exposure time are assumed to be in
# seconds, and the missing units that make the argument to the logarithmic
# function dimensionless are silently provided.
#
# In keeping with common practice, the definitions that follow treat "speeds"
# as dimensionless, so ISO 100 speed is given simply as '100'.  When
# calculating the logarithmic APEX quantities Av and Tv, the definitions
# provide the missing units, so the times can be given with any appropriate
# units.  For example, giving an exposure time of 1 minute as either '1 min' or
# '60 s' will result in Tv of -5.9068906.
#
# Exposure Value from f-number and Exposure Time
#
# Because nonlinear unit conversions only accept a single quantity,
# there is no direct conversion from f-number and exposure time to
# exposure value EV.  But the EV can be obtained from a combination of
# Av and Tv.  For example, the "sunny 16" rule states that correct
# exposure for a sunlit scene can achieved by using f/16 and an exposure
# time equal to the reciprocal of the ISO speed in seconds; this can be
# calculated as
#
#    ~Av(16) + ~Tv(1|100 s),
#
# which gives 14.643856.  These conversions may be combined with the
# ev100 conversion:
#
#    ev100(~Av(16) + ~Tv(1|100 s))
#
# to yield the assumed average scene luminance of 3200 cd/m^2.

# Astronomical time measurements
#
# Astronomical time measurement is a complicated matter.  The length of the
# true day at a given place can be 21 seconds less than 24 hours or 30 seconds
# over 24 hours.  The two main reasons for this are the varying speed of the
# earth in its elliptical orbit and the fact that the sun moves on the ecliptic
# instead of along the celestial equator.  To devise a workable system for time
# measurement, Simon Newcomb (1835-1909) used a fictitious "mean sun".
# Consider a first fictitious sun traveling along the ecliptic at a constant
# speed and coinciding with the true sun at perigee and apogee.  Then
# considering a second fictitious sun traveling along the celestial equator at
# a constant speed and coinciding with the first fictitious sun at the
# equinoxes.  The second fictitious sun is the "mean sun".  From this equations
# can be written out to determine the length of the mean day, and the tropical
# year.  The length of the second was determined based on the tropical year
# from such a calculation and was officially used from 1960-1967 until atomic
# clocks replaced astronomical measurements for a standard of time.  All of the
# values below give the mean time for the specified interval.
#
# See "Mathematical Astronomy Morsels" by Jean Meeus for more details
# and a description of how to compute the correction to mean time.

# Many astronomical values can be measured most accurately in a system of units
# using the astronomical unit and the mass of the sun as base units.  The
# uncertainty in the gravitational constant makes conversion to SI units
# significantly less accurate.

# The astronomical unit was defined to be the length of the of the semimajor
# axis of a massless object with the same year as the earth.  With such a
# definition in force, and with the mass of the sun set equal to one, Kepler's
# third law can be used to solve for the value of the gravitational constant.

# Kepler's third law says that (2 pi / T)^2 a^3 = G M where T is the orbital
# period, a is the size of the semimajor axis, G is the gravitational constant
# and M is the mass.  With M = 1 and T and a chosen for the earth's orbit, we
# find sqrt(G) = (2 pi / T) sqrt(AU^3).  This constant is called the Gaussian
# gravitational constant, apparently because Gauss originally did the
# calculations.  However, when the original calculation was done, the value
# for the length of the earth's year was inaccurate.  The value used is called
# the Gaussian year.  Changing the astronomical unit to bring it into
# agreement with more accurate values for the year would have invalidated a
# lot of previous work, so instead the astronomical unit has been kept equal
# to this original value.  This is accomplished by using a standard value for
# the Gaussian gravitational constant.  This constant is called k.

# Survey measures

# The US Metric Law of 1866 legalized the metric system in the USA and
# defined the meter in terms of the British system with the exact
# 1 meter = 39.37 inches.  On April 5, 1893 Thomas Corwin Mendenhall,
# Superintendent of Weights and Measures, decided, in what has become
# known as the "Mendenhall Order" that the meter and kilogram would be the
# fundamental standards in the USA.  The definition from 1866 was turned
# around to give an exact definition of the yard as 3600|3937 meters This
# definition was used until July of 1959 when the definition was changed
# to bring the US and other English-speaking countries into agreement; the
# Canadian value of 1 yard = 0.9144 meter (exactly) was chosen because it
# was approximately halfway between the British and US values; it had the
# added advantage of making 1 inch = 25.4 mm (exactly).  Since 1959, the
# "international" foot has been exactly 0.3048 meters.  At the same time,
# it was decided that any data expressed in feet derived from geodetic
# surveys within the US would continue to use the old definition and call
# the old unit the "survey foot." The US continues to define the statute
# mile, furlong, chain, rod, link, and fathom in terms of the US survey
# foot.

!category br_length                         "British Length Measures"

# The length measure in the UK was defined by a bronze bar manufactured in
# 1844.  Various conversions were sanctioned for convenience at different
# times, which makes conversions before 1963 a confusing matter.  Apparently
# previous conversions were never explicitly revoked.  Four different
# conversion factors appear below.  Multiply them times an imperial length
# units as desired.  The Weights and Measures Act of 1963 switched the UK away
# from their bronze standard and onto a definition of the yard in terms of the
# meter.  This happened after an international agreement in 1959 to align the
# world's measurement systems.

# In 1922, Seers, Jolly and
#   Johnson found the yard to be
#   0.91439841 meters.
#   Used starting in the 1930's.

# Density of a sugar syrup is frequently measured in candy making procedures.

# Using the brix table we can use this to produce a mapping from boiling point
# to density which makes all of the units interconvertible.  Because the brix
# table stops at 95 this approach works up to a boiling point elevation of 39 K
# or a boiling point of 139 C / 282 F, which is the "soft crack" stage in candy
# making.  The "hard crack" stage continues up to 310 F.

# Degrees brix measures sugar concentration by weigh as a percentage, so a
# solution that is 3 degrees brix is 3% sugar by weight.  This unit was named
# after Adolf Brix who invented a hydrometer that read this percentage
# directly.  This data is from Table 114 of NIST Circular 440, "Polarimetry,
# Saccharimetry and the Sugars".  It gives apparent specific gravity at 20
# degrees Celsius of various sugar concentrations.  As rendered below this
# data is converted to apparent density at 20 degrees Celsius using the
# density figure for water given in the same NIST reference.  They use the
# word "apparent" to refer to measurements being made in air with brass

# Heat Transfer
#
# Thermal conductivity, K, measures the rate of heat transfer across
# a material.  The heat transfered is
#     Q = K dT A t / L
# where dT is the temperature difference across the material, A is the
# cross sectional area, t is the time, and L is the length (thickness).
# Thermal conductivity is a material property.

thermal_conductivity    ? power / area (temperature/length)
thermal_resistivity     ? 1/thermal_conductivity

# Thermal conductance is the rate at which heat flows across a given
# object, so the area and thickness have been fixed.  It depends on
# the size of the object and is hence not a material property.

thermal_conductance     ? power / temperature
thermal_resistance      ? 1/thermal_conductance

# Thermal admittance is the rate of heat flow per area across an
# object whose thickness has been fixed.  Its reciprocal, thermal
# insulation, is used to for measuring the heat transfer per area
# of sheets of insulation or cloth that are of specified thickness.

# The bel was defined by engineers of Bell Laboratories to describe the

# has become more common.  The decibel is dimensionless since it reports a
# ratio, but it is used in various contexts to report a signal's power

# gsm (Grams per Square Meter), a sane, metric paper weight measure

gsm                     grams / meter^2

# In the USA, a collection of crazy historical paper measures are used.  Paper
# is measured as a weight of a ream of that particular type of paper.  This is
# sometimes called the "substance" or "basis" (as in "substance 20" paper).
# The standard sheet size or "basis size" varies depending on the type of
# paper.  As a result, 20 pound bond paper and 50 pound text paper are actually
# about the same weight.  The different sheet sizes were historically the most
# convenient for printing or folding in the different applications.  These
# different basis weights are standards maintained by American Society for
# Testing Materials (ASTM) and the American Forest and Paper Association
# (AF&PA).

# When paper is marked in units of M, it means the weight of 1000 sheets of the
# given size of paper.  To convert this to paper weight, divide by the size of
# the paper in question.

paperM                  lb / 1000

# In addition paper weight is reported in "caliper" which is simply the
# thickness of one sheet, typically in inches.  Thickness is also reported in
# "points" where a point is 1|1000 inch.  These conversions are supplied to
# convert these units roughly (using an approximate density) into the standard
# paper weight values.

# Gauge pressure functions
#
# Gauge pressure is measured relative to atmospheric pressure.  In the English
# system, where pressure is often given in pounds per square inch, gauge
# pressure is often indicated by 'psig' to distinguish it from absolute
# pressure, often indicated by 'psia'.  At the standard atmospheric pressure
# of 14.696 psia, a gauge pressure of 0 psig is an absolute pressure of 14.696
# psia; an automobile tire inflated to 31 psig has an absolute pressure of
# 45.696 psia.

#
# Wire Gauge
#
# This area is a nightmare with huge charts of wire gauge diameters
# that usually have no clear origin.  There are at least 5 competing wire gauge
# systems to add to the confusion.  The use of wire gauge is related to the
# manufacturing method: a metal rod is heated and drawn through a hole.  The
# size change can't be too big.  To get smaller wires, the process is repeated
# with a series of smaller holes.  Generally larger gauges mean smaller wires.
# The gauges often have values such as "00" and "000" which are larger sizes
# than simply "0" gauge.  In the tables that appear below, these gauges must be
# specified as negative numbers (e.g. "00" is -1, "000" is -2, etc).
# Alternatively, you can use the following units:
#

g00                      (-1)
g000                     (-2)
g0000                    (-3)
g00000                   (-4)
g000000                  (-5)
g0000000                 (-6)

# American Wire Gauge (AWG) or Brown & Sharpe Gauge appears to be the most
# important gauge. ASTM B-258 specifies that this gauge is based on geometric
# interpolation between gauge 0000, which is 0.46 inches exactly, and gauge 36
# which is 0.005 inches exactly.  Therefore, the diameter in inches of a wire
# is given by the formula 1|200 92^((36-g)/39).  Note that 92^(1/39) is close
# to 2^(1/6), so diameter is approximately halved for every 6 gauges.  For the
# repeated zero values, use negative numbers in the formula.  The same document
# also specifies rounding rules which seem to be ignored by makers of tables.
# Gauges up to 44 are to be specified with up to 4 significant figures, but no
# closer than 0.0001 inch.  Gauges from 44 to 56 are to be rounded to the
# nearest 0.00001 inch.
#
# In addition to being used to measure wire thickness, this gauge is used to
# measure the thickness of sheets of aluminum, copper, and most metals other
# than steel, iron and zinc.

# The following is from the Appendix to ASTM B 258
#
#    For example, in U.S. gage, the standard for sheet metal is based on the
#    weight of the metal, not on the thickness. 16-gage is listed as
#    approximately .0625 inch thick and 40 ounces per square foot (the original
#    standard was based on wrought iron at .2778 pounds per cubic inch; steel
#    has almost entirely superseded wrought iron for sheet use, at .2833 pounds
#    per cubic inch). Smaller numbers refer to greater thickness. There is no
#    formula for converting gage to thickness or weight.
#
# It's rather unclear from the passage above whether the plate gauge values are
# therefore wrong if steel is being used.  Reference [15] states that steel is
# in fact measured using this gauge (under the name Manufacturers' Standard
# Gauge) with a density of 501.84 lb/ft3 = 0.2904 lb/in3 used for steel.
# But this doesn't seem to be the correct density of steel (.2833 lb/in3 is
# closer).
#
# This gauge was established in 1893 for purposes of taxation.

!category grits                                          "Grit Sizes"

#
# Abrasive grit size
#
# Standards governing abrasive grit sizes are complicated, specifying
# fractions of particles that are passed or retained by different mesh
# sizes.  As a result, it is not possible to make precise comparisons
# of different grit standards.  The tables below allow the
# determination of rough equivlants by using median particle size.
#
# Standards in the USA are determined by the Unified Abrasives
# Manufacturers' Association (UAMA), which resulted from the merger of
# several previous organizations.  One of the old organizations was
# CAMI (Coated Abrasives Manufacturers' Institute).
#
# UAMA has a web page with plots showing abrasive particle ranges for
# various different grits and comparisons between standards.
#
# http://www.uama.org/Abrasives101/101Standards.html
#
# Abrasives are grouped into "bonded" abrasives for use with grinding
# wheels and "coated" abrasives for sandpapers and abrasive films.
# The industry uses different grit standards for these two
# categories.
#
# Another division is between "macrogrits", grits below 240 and
# "microgrits", which are above 240.  Standards differ, as do methods
# for determining particle size.  In the USA, ANSI B74.12 is the
# standard governing macrogrits.  ANSI B74.10 covers bonded microgrit
# abrasives, and ANSI B74.18 covers coated microgrit abrasives.  It
# appears that the coated standard is identical to the bonded standard
# for grits up through 600 but then diverges significantly.
#
# European grit sizes are determined by the Federation of European
# Producers of Abrasives.  http://www.fepa-abrasives.org
#
# They give two standards, the "F" grit for bonded abrasives and the
# "P" grit for coated abrasives.  This data is taken directly from
# their web page.

# FEPA P grit for coated abrasives is commonly seen on sandpaper in
# the USA where the paper will be marked P600, for example.  FEPA P
# grits are said to be more tightly constrained than comparable ANSI
# grits so that the particles are more uniform in size and hence give
# a better finish.

# Like the bonded grit, the coated macrogrits below 240 are taken from the
# FEPA F table.  Data above this is from the UAMA site.  Note that the coated
# and bonded standards are evidently the same from 240 up to 600 grit, but
# starting at 800 grit, the coated standard diverges.  The data from UAMA show
# that 800 grit coated has an average size slightly larger than the average
# size of 600 grit coated/bonded.  However, the 800 grit has a significantly
# smaller particle size variation.
#
# Because of this non-monotonicity from 600 grit to 800 grit this definition
# produces a warning about the lack of a unique inverse.

#
# Ring size. All ring sizes are given as the circumference of the ring.
#

# USA ring sizes.  Several slightly different definitions seem to be in
# circulation.  According to [15], the interior diameter of size n ring in
# inches is 0.32 n + 0.458 for n ranging from 3 to 13.5 by steps of 0.5.  The
# size 2 ring is inconsistently 0.538in and no 2.5 size is listed.
#
# However, other sources list 0.455 + 0.0326 n and 0.4525 + 0.0324 n as the
# diameter and list no special case for size 2.  (Or alternatively they are
# 1.43 + .102 n and 1.4216+.1018 n for measuring circumference in inches.)  One
# reference claimed that the original system was that each size was 1|10 inch
# circumference, but that source doesn't have an explanation for the modern
# system which is somewhat different.

# Old practice in the UK measured rings using the "Wheatsheaf gauge" with sizes
# specified alphabetically and based on the ring inside diameter in steps of
# 1|64 inch.  This system was replaced in 1987 by British Standard 6820 which
# specifies sizes based on circumference.  Each size is 1.25 mm different from
# the preceding size.  The baseline is size C which is 40 mm circumference.
# The new sizes are close to the old ones.  Sometimes it's necessary to go
# beyond size Z to Z+1, Z+2, etc.

#
# Traditional Japanese units (shakkanhou)
#
# The traditional system of weights and measures is called shakkanhou from the
# shaku and the ken.  Japan accepted SI units in 1891 and legalized conversions
# to the traditional system.  In 1909 the inch-pound system was also legalized,
# so Japan had three legally approved systems.  A change to the metric system
# started in 1921 but there was a lot of resistance.  The Measurement Law of
# October 1999 prohibits sales in anything but SI units.  However, the old
# units still live on in construction and as the basis for paper sizes of books
# and tools used for handicrafts.
#
# Note that units below use the Hepburn romanization system.  Some other
# systems would render "mou", "jou", and "chou" as "mo", "jo" and "cho".

# Japanese architecture is based on a "standard" size of tatami mat.
# Room sizes today are given in number of tatami, and this number
# determines the spacing between colums and hence sizes of sliding
# doors and paper screens.  However, every region has its own slightly
# different tatami size.  Edoma, used in and around Tokyo and
# Hokkaido, is becoming a nationwide standard.  Kyouma is used around
# Kyoto, Osaka and Kyuushu, and Chuukyouma is used around Nagoya.
# Note that the tatami all have the aspect ratio 2:1 so that the mats
# can tile the room with some of them turned 90 degrees.

# Celestial bodies

# Sidereal years from http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/phys_props_planets.html.  Data
# was updated in May 2001 based on the 1992 Explanatory Supplement to the
# Astronomical Almanac and the mean longitude rates.  Apparently the table of
# years in that reference is incorrect.

# The following are masses for planetary systems, not just the planet itself.
# The comments give the uncertainty in the denominators.  As noted above,
# masses are given relative to the solarmass because this is more accurate.
# The conversion to SI is uncertain because of uncertainty in G, the
# gravitational constant.
#
# Values are from http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/astro_constants.html

# Mean radius from http://ssd.jpl.nsaa.gov/phys_props_planets.html which in
# turn cites Global Earth Physics by CF Yoder, 1995.

#
# Atomic weights.  The atomic weight of an element is the ratio of the mass of
# a mole of the element to 1|12 of a mole of Carbon 12.  The Standard Atomic
# Weights apply to the elements as they occur naturally on earth.  Elements
# which do not occur naturally or which occur with wide isotopic variability do
# not have Standard Atomic Weights.  For these elements, the atomic weight is
# based on the longest lived isotope, as marked in the comments.  In some
# cases, the comment for these entries also gives a number which is an atomic
# weight for a different isotope that may be of more interest than the longest
# lived isotope.
